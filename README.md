# My Form-Validation Project
Created by Nathan Soh

## Why did I make this?
This was an opportunity to help reinforce the skills that I have picked up from studying. In this case, this was for validating forms, creating reusuable components, practicing the basic hooks of React and also creating a custom hook.
